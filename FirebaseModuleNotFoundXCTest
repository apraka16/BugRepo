## Bug
Firebase module not being identified on importing project module with XCTest Class.
## Solution
Add header filepath to `SearchPath`. Generally, in Test Target the user search path is empty on initialization. 
Add the same search path which is applicable for main project module.
`Search Paths -> User Header Search Path -> <Add> path. `
